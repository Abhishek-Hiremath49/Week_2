## Problem Statement
As electric vehicle (EV) adoption continues to grow, urban planners must anticipate infrastructure needsâ€”particularly the availability of charging stations. Inadequate planning can result in bottlenecks, reduced user satisfaction, and challenges in achieving sustainability goals.

Using the electric vehicle dataset (which includes information on EV populations, vehicle types, and historical charging usage), we aim to create a model that forecasts future EV adoption. For example, the model will predict the number of electric vehicles in upcoming years based on historical trends.

## Goal
Build a regression model to forecast future EV adoption demand using historical trends in EV growth, vehicle types, and regional data.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on the number of vehicles registered by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) each month. Data is segmented by county for both passenger vehicles and trucks.
